The project is derivative work from https://github.com/iampawan/PortfolioX

My idea is extract from the code all specific data and make it more generalized.

You could edit the data.dart file, recompile and you'll have your own portfolio site with the same design.

My version of this page could be found here - https://appcenter.online/portfoliox/
And with replaced data.dart with data_bg.dart - http://appcenter.online/portfoliox_bg/#/
